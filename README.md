# aPC
Implementation of arbitrary polynomial chaos

This is an implementation of arbitray polynomial chaos (aPC). It is used for uncertainty propgation in systems. Instead of selecting basis polynomials depending on the distribution of input variables, the aPC creates polynomials from the raw statistical moments of the used input data.
